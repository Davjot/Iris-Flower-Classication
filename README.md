The data set consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).

Four features were measured from each sample (in centimetres):

  --> Length of the sepals
  
  --> Width of the sepals
  
  --> Length of the petals
  
  --> Width of the petals

This project focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools. Algorithms used for predicting and getting accuracy are :

 --> Decision Tree Classifier

 --> K Nearest Classifier

 --> SVM

 --> Logistic Regression

 --> Naive Bayes

The program then divides the dataset into training and testing samples in 75:25 ratio randomly using train_test_learn() function available in sklearn module.

Accuracy score is then calculated by comparing with the correct results of the training dataset.
